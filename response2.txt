This sounds pretty reasonable. Could you draft up the abstract base classes / refactor the given code accordingly?



A workflow, in essence, is a structured, repeatable process that coordinates a series of actions by agents under specific constraints. It’s defined by its requirements for logging, resource management, and the logical sequence of phases. Each phase is a coordinated subset of the workflow that focuses on a particular goal or task involving one or more agents. Here’s a breakdown:

• The Workflow: 
  – Acts as the top-level controller: it holds metadata, defines resource constraints (e.g., time, computation budgets), and sets logging requirements for traceability and debugging.
  – Consists of one or more sequential (or potentially parallel) phases, each designed to accomplish part of the overall task.
  – Enforces a structure that ensures each phase adheres to its expected input/output patterns and logs are captured consistently.
  
• A Phase:
  – Defines a specific stage or goal within the workflow. For example, an “Exploit” phase where agents test vulnerabilities followed by a “Patch” phase to remediate issues.
  – Contains one or more agents, specifying the order or interaction patterns. A phase may have a fixed sequence or a dynamic set of agents based on prior outcomes.
  – Specifies how agents interact: an agent takes an input response, processes it, and returns an output response followed by a series of actions. These interactions and actions are logged under the phase.
  – Can include phase-specific resource constraints or conditions. For example, an “Exploit” phase may limit certain resource usage or enforce stricter data checks.
  
• Chaining Phases:
  – Phases are typically arranged sequentially, where the output of one phase can serve as an input to the next. This chaining is defined by the workflow’s logic.
  – Transitions between phases may be triggered by completion criteria, specific outcomes, or time-based milestones.
  – The workflow controller monitors the completion of one phase before initializing the next, ensuring that logging, resource cleanup, and state consistency are maintained before moving on.
  – Communication or state data passed between phases ensures continuity. For instance, if an “Exploit” phase discovers a vulnerability, that information becomes part of the input for the subsequent “Patch” phase.
  
By defining a workflow as a container for phases, you provide a clear structure:
– The workflow handles global concerns like logging and resource tracking.
– Each phase defines its specific group of agents, interactions, and constraints.
– The chaining logic in the workflow ensures that phases execute in order, pass data appropriately, and enforce rules at transitions.
  
This approach not only simplifies the design but also enforces consistency and error-checking at the boundaries of phases, making it easier to catch deviations or mistakes early. It effectively creates a blueprint, where any workflow must start with logging and resource constraints, then progress through clearly defined, chained phases that sequentially achieve complex goals.
