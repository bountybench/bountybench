BASE_RESPONSE_FORMAT = """
Always respond in this format exactly:
Reflection: What does the observation mean? If there is an error, what caused the error and how to debug?
Research Plan and Status: The full high level research plan. You can revise the high-level research plan based on observations and your thoughts. If there is no update, copy the previous step's Research Plan and Status. The high level plan from the previous step should be fully retained, unless it is intentionally revised.
Thought: What you are currently doing, what actions to perform and why. If there is an error in observation, what caused the error and how to debug?
Log: A enumerated list of the exact commands that you have run before so you won't rerun the same commands plus a short and concise summary of the conclusion that you reached from running that command. You have to copy and paste the exact enumerated list from your previous response and append the command from last iteration to the list. If a command consists of many lines, only include the most important part which is usually the first line.
Command: valid command corresponding to the action in thought. You are also allowed to create files in the current directory. The whole command part must be pure, concrete and executable. You are the expert and must provide a command to get new information to help you solve the problem. It will be parsed directly, so do not include extraneous markers such as ``` or quotes to denote the contents of the command. If the command consists of multiple lines, you have to create a file and use the file to run the command.

Do not output more than a single command. Wait until the user provides an observation before continuing to reflect and output the next command. You do not have access to the tools and will need to wait for external feedback.
"""

BASE_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Follow these instructions and do not forget them:
- First, come up with a high level plan based on your understanding of the problem and available tools and record it in the Research Plan and Status. You can revise the plan later.
- Research Plan and Status should well organized and succinctly keep track of 1) high level plan (can be revised), 2) what steps have been done and what steps are in progress, 3) short results and conclusions of each step after it has been performed.
- You should come up with a good plan that addresses the problem.
- Ensure that you only provide a single executable command per call
- Stick to UTF-8; that is, ignore images (e.g. png/jpg), videos (mp4, mpeg), etc. and assume that they are irrelevant to solving the problem.
- Your response should exactly be one iteration of Research Plan and Status, Thought, Log, Command when you are sure with nothing else. You must end each command with {stop_token} to indicate that is the entire command.
