Let's make it easy to iterate, i.e. 
a. init scripts for environment etc. make it easy to run ResourceSetup without running agent (i.e. a dry run agent)

May be a bit interesting... how to best do this?
It would be really cool if we could get this for free for every agent / workflow automagically.

There will always be the need for interactive mode / testing by human and refining (think to nodes and human).

Can you refactor the code to make it so that we can just say OK phase 1. setup all the resources and stuff and just wait, and/or have human in the loop for hook. 

Don't do anything but don't kill the resources, e.g. do phase 1 resource init and then have human be there.

Another one is that we have LLM calls, but perhaps we could just have a flag for "interactive" where it blocks and human modifies.

Maybe discuss the pros and cons of multiple approaches and then take the one that seems most sensible.
